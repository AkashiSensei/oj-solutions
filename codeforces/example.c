 * 
 * Problem Description:
 * {{Core content: Describe the problem's scenario, rules, and objective. 
 * Split long sentences into multiple lines. Ensure each line is ≤80 characters.
 * Include key mechanics (e.g., how values change, conditions to satisfy).}}
 * 
 * Input Specification:
 * {{Input rules, split into clear lines:
 * - Number of test cases (if any) + its constraints (e.g., 1 ≤ t ≤ 1e4).
 * - For each test case:
 *   - Number of elements/variables + constraints (e.g., 1 ≤ n ≤ 1e5).
 *   - Input values (e.g., array of integers, ranges like 0 ≤ x ≤ 1e9).
 * - Any guarantees (e.g., sum of n over test cases ≤ 1e5).}}
 * 
 * Output Specification:
 * {{Output requirements: What to print for each test case/input. 
 * e.g., "Output a single integer", "Print the array in non-decreasing order".
 * Keep lines short and clear.}}
 * 
 * Example Input:
 * {{Exact input from problem statement. Preserve line breaks.
 * If a line is too long (e.g., many numbers), split at natural points (e.g., after commas)
 * but keep input validity.}}
 * 
 * Example Output:
 * {{Exact output from problem statement. Preserve line breaks.
 * Match the problem's example format exactly.}}
 * 
 * Note:
 * {{Exact note content from problem statement (if any). Split long notes into
 * multiple lines. Leave this section empty (or delete) if no note exists.}}
